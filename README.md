# Anvil Cloud
##### Scientific project name: *Cumulonimbus incus*

Rapidly prototype and instantly deploy scripts in your own personal anvil cloud.

Anvil Cloud capitalizes on the availability of free cloud services with aggressive uptimes,
giving you an easy interface for scripting in the cloud where you only have to deploy once.

## So many analogies

There's two entire sets of analogies, in meteorology and in (non-modern) metalworking.

"An accessory cloud is a cloud which is dependent on a larger cloud system for its development and continuance."

Anvil Cloud is a cloud which is dependent on a larger cloud system for its development and continuance.

Specifically, Anvil Cloud wouldn't be *developed* if not for larger cloud systems like RedHat Cloud, Heroku, Cloud Foundry, et cetera.

Continuance: RedHat Cloud at least has aggressive *continuance*, restarting your server quickly when it fails.
(And obviously Anvil Cloud's *continuance* depends on the host cloud's *continuance*.)

"high level"? "high level" Write high level scripts (or "accessories")

"Anvil"? -> ...

### Codesmithing

Setup your Anvil and hammer out some code!
"It's codesmithin' time!" "Get your codesmith on!'' "Codesmithing." *cough*

We've even got a Forge as part of are back-end with Firebase...
which let's you view the [code, metal] in a more raw form

## Setup

* Fork or clone the repository

* Create an account with one of the cloud service providers

* Create a repository with one of the cloud service providers
  (and perform any setup required, such as installing the RHC client tools)

* Add the host-cloud repository as a remote to the local anvil-cloud repository

* Push to the remote

## Todo

	#!/usr/bin/env [dropdown]
	               [node]
	               [coffee]
	               [python]
	               [...]

* Output and debugging
